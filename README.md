# 100DaysOfSwift

This is a course of 100 days with swift from Paul Hudson, it is very interesting and I plan to pass it to the end.

Project1 - Set up the Xcode development environment. We wrote a few lines of code to make a table view in our interface,
After we finished, I attached another method by myself with which you can delete cells.
Added a transition, by tapping on the cell, we get to a new ViewController that displays the image from our array + 
added a method that allows you to hide the NavigationController by tapping on the image to fully display the image.
I customized the cells a little, rounded them up and painted them.
Change the font in the cell through the code, made the sorting by name, 
so that the cells are displayed in chronological order made the display of the name of the image in the style (1 out of 10) when switching to the image.

Project2 - In this project, we made a game with the ability to select the desired flag, 
the name of which is displayed at the very top, depending on the correct or incorrect answer, 
a notification appears, added a score counter that is displayed in real time, after playing 5 games, 
a notification appears about the number of correct and incorrect answers.

Project3 - We took our first project as a basis and added the ability to share images there.
