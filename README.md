Project2 - In this project, we made a game with the ability to select the desired flag, 
the name of which is displayed at the very top, depending on the correct or incorrect answer, 
a notification appears, added a score counter that is displayed in real time, after playing 5 games, 
a notification appears about the number of correct and incorrect answers.

Project3 - We took our first project as a basis and added the ability to share images there.
